Data Types in the Ruby World

There are different kinds of Data types in Ruby just like any other programming language


=> Integer = This is a whole number eg. 7, 9, etc
=> Double = This is a number with two decimal places at the back eg. 3.00, 4.59, etc
=> Char = This is a single digit number or character eg. 'a', 'B', 'J', etc
=> String = This is anything or any bunch of or group of characters covered with
opening and closing quotation marks eg. "This is my first batch in the year 2016", "43542134", 'Year 2017'
=> Boolean = This is a statement result to signify true or false
=> Float = This is a number that continues to repeat the inflectional part of it
22/7 = 3.148148148148148 = 3.148
acceleration due to gravity = 9.186186186187188189

=> Derived Data type = This is the Data type that we create during the process of writing program
eg. Bird bird = new Bird => Ruby (bird = Bird.new )
